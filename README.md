# Code-Cracker
 Code cracker made with python (not real)
 
 This is a program that will open a file, determine how many units "letters or numbers" 
 in the so called password that is in the password.txt file. 
 
 After opening/reading the file and determining how many "units", it will use a dictionary 
 of letters/numbers and a loop until it successfully matches a correct password.
